# Module-03-Password-Generator
Application will generate a random password for employee use

# Project Status
Submitted for evaluation.  Would like guidance on creating loops to redirect users when their responses are invalid.

# Password Generator Starter Code
Some code provided to start, with some instruction to guide the process.

# Installation
Used original HTML and style.css files from assignment.
Used Javascript to include window prompts in the webpage.
Added pop-up alert windows when user creates an invalid set of criteria

# Usage
Users can generate a random password at a length of their choosin between 8 & 128 characters.
Users can specify whether they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters and/or numbers in the pasword that is generated.
When a user inputs an invalid length (not a number between 8 & 128), an alert pops up aand the function ends.
When a user does not select any character set the user gets an alert pop up to choose at least one and the function ends.

# Original Assignment Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

# Roadmap
Ideally the User would be redirected to the original window prompt to restart the function and generate the desired random password. I haven't been able to successully program that function.

# Authors and acknowledgement
During creation, classmates have helped by answering questions, and providing some basic code (David Proto) that worked for them. Shout out to Chris Lemmon for hosting a lengthy zoom study group!
